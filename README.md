# odin-library

Project: Library Application

Description:

Build a small library application which allows users to input books into their library.  Display the user's library of books on the page.  Allow users to toggle read status and remove books from their library.

This project utilizes what I've learned in recent lessons on objects and object constructors to store and organize the data.
